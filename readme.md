### Project Author - _Ronnie Petty_

## About this Build System
---
* Gulp based build management that will streamline development, production and asset collection
* Separated source for organization
    * dist directory holds the distributed files i.e. the actual banners and assets
    * gulp directory holds the customized Gulp modules to send to gulpfile.js
    * src holds the source for builds in this case the Sass and Sprites directories and files
* HTML files for four standard banner sizes set up with a basic shell to get you started
* A completely customizable package set for easy boilerplating of other projects and ad unit requirements
    * These HTML files have some basic tag structures and a simple to use class structure in place
    * There are also optional CDN imports for useful external libraries such as Greensock's GSAP and Snap.svg
* A basic Sass structure including a Partials and Modules folder with some generic banner styles to start
* A builder for sprites and Sass implementation to go with it
* A helpers directory with additional files and resources to deal with project customization
